inspired by Ted Wise's running-apps workflow (on https://github.com/ctwise/alfred-workflows), I tried to make a similar thing (in python) that makes use of alfred-workflows(https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow) to select windows as opposed to applications. 

This also brings all the windows of the application to the front.
